Project Description
Image Restoration & Background Removal App is a web-based application that allows users to upload an image and perform a variety of image processing operations. The core functionalities include background removal, noise reduction, scratch removal, contrast enhancement, filtering (Gaussian and Median), sharpening, and computation of quality metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and mIoU. This tool is especially useful for enhancing old or damaged images and assessing the quality of restoration.
